# INTRODUCTION :-

Electric vehicles are the key technology to decarbonise road transport, a sector that accounts for around one-sixth of global emissions. Ambitious policies continue to be critical to growth in electric vehicle markets worldwide.Dashboard presents analysis of dataset with Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing

# KPI'S REQUIREMENTS :-

Total Vehicles:

* Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.

Average Electric Range: 

* Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:

* Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
* Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.

Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:

Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.

Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.
